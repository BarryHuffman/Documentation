##Disassemble the RT3200 without damage
(allowing access to serial, and JTAG.)

You will need at least one of the following, and a screwdriver:
Plastic spudger, credit card, tooth pick, guitar pick.

1. Remove the adhesive labels below the device's legs to reveal four screws.
(Use a razor blade/scalpel if you wish to save them)

2. Unscrew the 4 flush screws, and using the spudger start at one corner of the legs.
Work around from one end to the other slowly as the tabs unlock.
(You will hear clicks for each tab)
##No force should be used

3. Do the same for the other side, and remove the legs.
You now will see two round screws this holds the PCB sled in place, ignore them for now.

4. Inside the front face of the router there's a tiny delicate clip.
Use a rigid flat object, and place it within the inside of the clip against the walled ledge,
and roll it off using leverage.
(Or gently rotate the object clockwise to nudge the clip off the ledge)
##DO PULL OR PRY THE CLIP WITH FORCE, IT'S DELICATE!

5. Place a "shim" between the ledge and clip to prevent the clip from re-engaging.
Use a long object to push within the notched zone that the clip protrudes through.
Doing this with enough force applied will expose a gap on the front face panel which a shim can be placed to hold it open.

6. Remove the shim on the clip, and run a spudger along the newly exposed face.
The shim will fall inside when all pressure is released, slowly remove the face.

7. Remove the previous two round screws under the legs, and tilt the back side of the router towards the ground, the sled should fall out.
(There's also a notched square on the top corner exposing a piece of the sled which can be pressed against)

If neither option works slide a spudger around the back side and place a shim for every notch,
aligned with the corresponding notched areas on the front face side.

8. Unplug the antennas, and remember their locations as one is for the 802.11bgn, the other 802.11ax.

9. Unscrew the 3 outer screws to remove the PCB from the sled.

##DON'T REMOVE THE WHITE CIRCLED SCREWS THAT HOLD THE HEATSINK ON THE PCB!
